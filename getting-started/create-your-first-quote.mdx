## Overview

Creating a quote is the starting point of every job in **Estizee**.\
Quotes define **pricing, service scope, and job conditions**, and they power everything that follows—scheduling, invoicing, payments, and reminders.

Estizee offers **two quote types** to match how you work:

- **Turbo Quote** – Fast, simplified estimates
- **Advanced Quote** – Detailed, rule-based pricing

You can use one or both, depending on your business model.

## Before You Start

Before creating your first quote, make sure you have:

- Your **base rates** configured
- Your **service types** enabled (window cleaning, pressure washing, etc.)
- Your **pricing rules and surcharges** reviewed
- Your **business info and branding** set

These settings ensure accurate pricing and professional-looking quotes.

    After the customer approves the quote:

    - The quote status updates to **Approved**
    - The job becomes eligible for scheduling
    - No pricing changes are allowed (unless admin override is enabled)

    Approval ensures pricing and scope are locked.
