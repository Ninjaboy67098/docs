## How Estizee is Structured

**Estizee** is a modular, workflow-driven platform where every feature is connected.\
At its core, Estizee follows the natural lifecycle of a service job—from **estimate to payment**—while giving administrators full control over pricing, scheduling, and operations.

The system is composed of five main layers:

1. **Estimation & Quotes**
2. **Jobs & Scheduling**
3. **Invoices & Payments**
4. **Customers & Communication**
5. **Admin & Business Settings**

Each layer builds on the previous one.

## Job Lifecycle Overview

Every service request in Estizee follows a defined lifecycle to ensure consistency, automation, and traceability.

### **Typical lifecycle flow:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Estimate Created" defaultOpen>
    A quote is generated using Turbo or Advanced pricing logic.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Quote Sent / Shared" defaultOpen>
    Quotes can be shared via PDF, email, or SMS.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Quote Approved" defaultOpen>
    The customer approves the quote (manually or through the customer portal).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Job Scheduled" defaultOpen>
    The job is assigned a date, time window, and optionally a team member.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Job Completed" defaultOpen>
    The job is marked as completed in the system.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Invoice Generated" defaultOpen>
    Invoices are automatically created from approved quotes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Payment Collected" defaultOpen>
    The customer pays online via Stripe or via configured offline methods.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Follow-ups & Reminders" defaultOpen>
    1. Automated reminders and future scheduling prompts are triggered.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## **Core Modules Breakdown**

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  ### 1. Estimator & Quotes
</CardGroup>

The Estimator is the foundation of Estizee.

- Turbo Quotes for fast, simplified pricing
- Advanced Quotes for detailed, rule-based pricing
- Dynamic surcharges based on job conditions
- Optional admin override using hourly rates
- Automatic job description generation

Quotes in Estizee are structured data—not just prices—allowing them to drive scheduling, invoicing, and reporting.

### 2. Jobs & Scheduling

Jobs represent approved work ready to be performed.

- Calendar-based scheduling
- Open and blocked time slots
- Team or employee assignment
- Job status tracking
- Calendar reminders and notifications

Scheduling is intentionally separated from quoting to prevent premature commitments.

### 3. Invoices & Payments

Invoices are automatically generated once a job reaches completion.

- Quote-to-invoice conversion
- Stripe payment integration
- Payment status tracking
- Partial or manual payments (if enabled)
- Paid-job confirmation triggers

This guarantees billing accuracy and eliminates pricing discrepancies.

### 4. Customers & Communication

Each customer in Estizee has a centralized profile.

- Contact information
- Property details
- Quote, job, and invoice history
- Communication preferences
- Automated SMS and email notifications

All customer interactions are tied to real jobs and transactions.

### 5. Admin & Business Settings

Admins define how Estizee operates.

- Business profile and branding
- Base rates and pricing goals
- Residential and commercial pricing rules
- Notification and reminder settings
- Team management
- Calendar and availability rules
- Coupons and promotions

These settings control the logic used throughout the platform.

## Navigation Structure

Estizee uses a dual navigation system to separate daily operations from administrative tasks.

### Bottom Navigation (Daily Operations)

- **Home** – Overview and quick actions
- **Calendar** – Scheduling and availability
- **Jobs** – Active and completed jobs
- **Invoices** – Billing and payments
- **Settings** – Business configuration

### Header / Menu Navigation (Administration)

- Admin
- Analytics
- Ads Management
- Online Booking Page
- Inventory
- Asset Tracking
- Support
- Feedback
- Pricing

This structure keeps everyday workflows fast and uncluttered.

## Data Flow Overview

Estizee is fully data-driven.

- Quotes generate structured job data
- Jobs inherit approved pricing and service details
- Invoices inherit quote data automatically
- Payments update job and customer status
- Notifications respond to lifecycle events

Data flows in one direction—clean, consistent, and auditable.

## Automation & Safeguards

Estizee includes built-in safeguards to prevent operational errors:

- Jobs cannot be scheduled without quote approval
- Invoices cannot be modified after payment
- Pricing rules prevent undercharging
- Status transitions are controlled
- Admin overrides are tracked

These safeguards ensure consistency at scale.

## Built for Real Service Businesses

Estizee is not a generic CRM.\
It is purpose-built for **service businesses that need speed, accuracy, and automation—without operational chaos**.

Flexible where it should be. Strict where it must be.
