## Common Causes

- **Overlapping Jobs**: Multiple jobs assigned to the same team member at the same time.
- **Buffer Time Not Set**: Insufficient time between jobs leads to overlaps.
- **Manual Scheduling Errors**: Admins or managers accidentally schedule conflicting jobs.
- **Team Unavailability**: Team member marked unavailable but assigned a job.

## Resolution Steps

1. **Identify Conflicts**: Review the Calendar view for overlapping job entries or warnings.
2. **Check Team Availability**: Confirm which team members are available during the conflicting times.
3. **Adjust Scheduling**: Reschedule one or more jobs to a different time or assign to an available team member.
4. **Confirm Changes**: Ensure all changes are saved and notifications are sent to affected team members and customers.

## Best Practices

- Set buffer times between jobs to prevent overlaps.
- Use filters and color-coding to easily spot conflicts.
- Regularly review the calendar for potential conflicts in advance.
- Communicate schedule changes promptly to both customers and team members.

Proper management of calendar conflicts in Estizee ensures smooth operations, avoids team overloading, and maintains customer satisfaction.
