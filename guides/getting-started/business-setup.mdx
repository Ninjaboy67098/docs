description: "The Business Setup section is where you configure everything that makes Service Mate work for your company."
---

These settings define how your quotes are calculated, how customers see your business, how your team operates, and how jobs flow from estimate to payment.

This setup is typically completed **once**, then adjusted over time as your business grows.

## 1. Business Information

This section controls how your company appears across quotes, invoices, customer communications, and legal documents.

**Required fields:**

- Business Name
- Business Address
- Phone Number
- Email Address
- Website (optional)

**Optional but recommended:**

- Business Logo (used on PDFs and customer-facing documents)

> 💡 _Tip:_ This information is automatically injected into all quotes, invoices, and receipts—no need to re-enter it later.

## 2. Base Rates

This is the financial foundation of your pricing engine.

### Base Hourly Rate

Set your default hourly rate used for:

- Manual pricing overrides

---

## 3. Residential Rate Settings

Configure how residential jobs are priced.

Common inputs include:

- Price per square foot
- Minimum service charge
- Story / height multipliers
- Add-ons (screens, tracks, deep cleaning, first-time service, etc.)

Each toggle or input in the estimator is directly tied to these values.

> Any change here instantly updates all **new smart quotes** going forward.

## 4. Commercial Rate Settings

Designed for storefronts, offices, buildings, and multi-unit properties.

You can configure:

- Per-window or per-pane pricing
- Square footage pricing
