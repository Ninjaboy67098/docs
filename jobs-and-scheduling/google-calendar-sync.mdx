This ensures that all jobs, appointments, and team assignments are synchronized in real-time.

## **Benefits**

- **Real-time Updates**: Any changes in Estizee automatically reflect in Google Calendar and vice versa.
- **Team Coordination**: Team members can view their assigned jobs in Google Calendar.
- **Conflict Prevention**: Avoid double-booking by maintaining a single source of truth for schedules.

## **Setup Process**

1. Navigate to the Calendar Settings in Estizee.
2. Select "Integrations" and choose Google Calendar.
3. Sign in with your Google account.
4. Grant permissions to allow Estizee to access your calendar.
5. Select which calendar(s) to sync with Estizee.
6. Save settings to activate the integration.

## **Sync Behavior**

- **Two-way Sync**: Jobs created, updated, or deleted in Estizee automatically reflect in Google Calendar.
- **Notifications**: Changes in Google Calendar do not automatically update Estizee pricing or customer details; only scheduling details are synced.
- **Multiple Calendars**: You can sync multiple Google Calendars with Estizee for different teams or locations.

## **Best Practices**

- Review calendar permissions periodically to ensure sync continues to function.
- Avoid manual changes in Google Calendar for Estizee jobs to prevent discrepancies.
- Use color-coding in Google Calendar to differentiate between teams or job types.
- Regularly monitor sync logs in Estizee for errors or conflicts.

Proper Google Calendar integration keeps Estizee schedules accurate, improves team coordination, and prevents scheduling conflicts.
