## **Sync Behavior**

- **Two-way Sync**: Jobs created, updated, or deleted in Estizee automatically reflect in Google Calendar.
- **Notifications**: Changes in Google Calendar do not automatically update Estizee pricing or customer details; only scheduling details are synced.
- **Multiple Calendars**: You can sync multiple Google Calendars with Estizee for different teams or locations.

## **Best Practices**

- Review calendar permissions periodically to ensure sync continues to function.
- Avoid manual changes in Google Calendar for Estizee jobs to prevent discrepancies.
- Use color-coding in Google Calendar to differentiate between teams or job types.
- Regularly monitor sync logs in Estizee for errors or conflicts.

Proper Google Calendar integration keeps Estizee schedules accurate, improves team coordination, and prevents scheduling conflicts.
