Understanding this flow helps track job progress, manage team accountability, and communicate accurately with customers.

## **Status Definitions**

- **On-Site (IF)**: The team is currently on the customer’s property to evaluate or start the job.
- **Quoted**: A quote has been generated and sent to the customer.
- **Pending**: The job is awaiting customer approval.
- **Approved**: The customer has approved the quote and scheduled the job.
- **Scheduled**: The job is assigned a date and time on the calendar.
- **On Our Way**: The team is en route to the job location.
- **Started**: Work has begun on the job.
- **Completed**: The job has been finished on-site.
- **Invoiced**: An invoice has been generated for the completed job.
- **Paid**: Payment has been received and processed.

## **Flow Guidelines**

1. Jobs typically begin at **Quoted** or **On-Site (IF)** for initial evaluation.
2. After quoting, the status moves to **Pending** until the customer approves.
3. Once approved, the job becomes **Scheduled** with an assigned date and team member.
4. On the day of service, the status updates sequentially: **On Our Way → Started → Completed**.
5. After completion, an invoice is generated (**Invoiced**) and marked **Paid** once payment is received.

## **Best Practices**

- Update job status promptly to maintain accurate records and communication.
- Use status notifications to keep customers informed when appropriate.
- Monitor jobs in **Pending** or **Scheduled** to ensure timely follow-up.
- Ensure invoices are issued immediately after completion to streamline payment processing.

Maintaining a clear job status flow in Estizee ensures efficient operations, accountability, and transparency for both team members and customers.
