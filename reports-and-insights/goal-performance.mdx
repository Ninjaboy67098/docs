Monitoring goal performance provides insights into productivity, efficiency, and business growth.

All metrics apply to **new quotes, jobs, and invoices**.

## **Key Metrics**

- **Job Completion Goals**: Tracks the number of completed jobs versus targets.
- **Quote Approval Goals**: Measures how many quotes are approved compared to the total sent.
- **Team Performance**: Evaluates individual or team achievement against assigned goals.

## **Viewing Goal Performance**
