## **Payment Statuses**

- **Pending**: The invoice has been generated but no payment has been received yet.
- **Processing**: The payment has been initiated by the customer and is currently being processed.
- **Paid**: The payment has been successfully received and processed.
- **Failed**: The payment attempt did not go through due to errors or declined transactions.

- Address **Failed** payments promptly by notifying the customer and retrying the payment.
- Record any **Refunded** payments clearly to maintain accurate financial records.
- Use payment status reports for cash flow management and accounting purposes.
