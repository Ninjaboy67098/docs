Understanding this flow ensures accurate invoicing and smooth payment processing.

All steps apply to **new quotes and completed jobs**.

## **Flow Overview**

1. **Quote Created**: A quote is generated using Turbo or Advanced Quote and shared with the customer.
2. **Quote Approved**: Customer approves the quote, moving the job to **Approved** status.
3. **Job Scheduled**: The approved job is assigned a date, time, and team member(s) for execution.
4. **Job Completed**: After the service is performed, the job status is updated to **Completed**.
5. **Invoice Generated**: Estizee automatically creates an invoice based on the approved quote and any additional adjustments or surcharges applied during the job.
6. **Invoice Sent**: The invoice is delivered to the customer via email, PDF, or both.
7. **Payment Received**: Once the customer pays, the invoice status updates to **Paid**, completing the quote-to-invoice cycle.

## **Best Practices**

- Ensure all job details and pricing adjustments are finalized before generating the invoice.
- Use the invoice preview feature to confirm accuracy before sending to the customer.
- Maintain clear records of all quotes, approvals, and invoices for accounting and reporting purposes.
- Automate reminders for unpaid invoices to improve cash flow.

Proper management of the quote-to-invoice flow in Estizee ensures accurate billing, efficient operations, and timely payments.
