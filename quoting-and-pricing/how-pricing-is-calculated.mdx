Pricing is determined by combining base rates, service modifiers, add-ons, and optional surcharges based on the selected services and property characteristics.

All calculations apply to **new quotes only** and are automatically applied during the quoting process.

## **Base Pricing**

The starting point for every quote is the base pricing metric, which can be:

- Hourly rate (for labor-based services)
- Price per square foot or unit
- Flat-rate pricing for standard services

The base price ensures that all quotes reflect your minimum profitable rate.

## **Property Modifiers**

Property-specific factors adjust the base price based on complexity, difficulty, or unique characteristics:

- Number of stories or height multipliers
- Accessibility or restricted entry
- Property type (house, condo, apartment)

These modifiers are applied automatically when relevant inputs are selected.

## **Service Add-Ons**

Optional services or special conditions are added to the quote through add-ons:

- Screens, tracks, or frame cleaning
- Deep cleaning or first-time service surcharges
- Post-construction or hard-water removal

Add-ons can be configured as flat fees, per-unit charges, or multipliers.

## **Commercial & Frequency Adjustments**

For commercial clients, pricing can include:

- Frequency-based discounts (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly)
- Large property or multi-unit surcharges
- Custom admin adjustments for complex jobs

These adjustments are applied after base pricing and add-ons.

## **Calculation Order**

Pricing rules are applied in the following sequence:

1. Base pricing
2. Minimum service checks
3. Property modifiers
4. Service add-ons
5. Frequency or commercial adjustments
6. Manual or admin overrides (if applicable)

This ensures consistent and predictable final quotes.

## **Best Practices**

- Review base rates and modifiers regularly
- Keep add-ons clear and easy to understand
- Test quote outputs for edge cases before sharing with customers
- Document any manual overrides for audit and training purposes

When configured correctly, Estizee automatically calculates accurate and profitable quotes for both residential and commercial jobs.
