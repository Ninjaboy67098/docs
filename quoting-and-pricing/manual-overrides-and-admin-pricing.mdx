This provides flexibility for unique or complex jobs while maintaining overall pricing control.

All manual overrides apply to **new quotes only** and are tracked for auditing purposes.

## **Admin Access**

Only users with administrator or manager roles can apply manual overrides. This ensures that pricing control remains centralized and prevents unauthorized changes.

## **When to Use Overrides**

Manual overrides are typically used for:

- Custom or one-off quotes
- Complex commercial properties
- Situations requiring special discounts or adjustments
- Correcting automated quote errors

## **How Overrides Work**

Administrators can:

- Adjust base rates for specific quotes
- Add or remove service add-ons
- Apply or modify surcharges and multipliers
- Modify total quote amounts directly

Overrides take precedence over automated pricing calculations but are recorded to maintain transparency.

## **Best Practices**

- Document reasons for all manual adjustments
- Use overrides sparingly to preserve automated pricing consistency
- Regularly review override history to ensure compliance and profitability
- Train administrators on the impact of overrides and pricing rules

Proper use of manual overrides ensures flexibility for special cases without undermining the integrity of Estizee’s automated pricing system.
