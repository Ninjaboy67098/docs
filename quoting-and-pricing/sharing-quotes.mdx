Proper sharing ensures timely customer responses and a smooth workflow from quote to payment.

All sharing settings apply to **new quotes only**.

## **Sharing Options**

Estizee supports several methods to share quotes:

- **Email**: Sends a PDF version of the quote directly to the customer’s email address.
- **PDF download**: Allows administrators to download the quote for manual delivery.
- **SMS**: Sends a secure link to the quote via text message for fast access (requires customer consent).

## **Sending a Quote**

1. Generate the quote in Estizee using Turbo or Advanced Quote.
2. Verify the customer’s contact information.
3. Select the preferred sharing method(s).
4. The customer receives the quote via the chosen channel(s).

## **Best Practices**

- Always confirm that customer contact information is accurate.
- Use SMS for quick, on-the-go delivery and email for detailed or recordable communication.
- Keep messages clear and professional.
- Monitor quote delivery and follow up if necessary.

Proper quote sharing ensures customers receive timely information, which helps improve response rates and overall satisfaction.
