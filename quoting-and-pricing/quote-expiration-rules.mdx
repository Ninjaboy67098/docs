Expiration rules help manage customer expectations, encourage timely responses, and maintain accurate scheduling.

All expiration settings apply to **new quotes only**.

## **Setting Expiration Periods**

Administrators can define a default expiration period for all quotes. Typical settings include:

- Number of days a quote is valid from creation
- Specific expiration dates for one-off quotes

## **Notification of Expiration**

Estizee can notify customers before a quote expires to encourage timely acceptance. Notifications may include:

- Email reminders
- SMS alerts (if opted in)

## **Handling Expired Quotes**

When a quote expires, Estizee automatically:

- Marks the quote as expired in the system
- Prevents acceptance or payment processing for the expired quote
- Allows administrators to renew or duplicate the quote if necessary

## **Best Practices**

- Set expiration periods based on typical customer decision timelines
- Use notifications to prompt action before expiration
- Regularly review expired quotes to identify opportunities for follow-up or adjustment
- Maintain consistency in expiration rules across similar quote types

Proper configuration of quote expiration ensures clarity, reduces stale quotes, and encourages timely customer decisions.
