title: "Surcharges & Multipliers Explained"
description: "In Estizee, surcharges and multipliers adjust the base price to account for additional complexity, special conditions, or optional services."

These tools allow you to maintain pricing accuracy while reflecting real-world job variations.

All adjustments apply to **new quotes only**.

## **Surcharges**

Surcharges are fixed or percentage-based additions applied to the base quote under specific conditions. Common surcharges include:

- Hard-to-reach windows or multi-story properties
- Restricted access or difficult entry
- Specialized cleaning requirements (e.g., post-construction, hard water removal)
- Equipment or safety requirements

Surcharges can be configured as:

- **Flat fees**: a fixed dollar amount added to the quote
- **Percentage-based**: a percent of the base price or total quote

## **Multipliers**

Multipliers increase the base price proportionally based on specific factors. Examples include:

- Property height or number of stories
- Job complexity level
- Service frequency adjustments
- Volume-based adjustments for large properties or multi-unit buildings

Multipliers are applied **after base pricing** and can stack with other multipliers, but should be carefully managed to avoid overcharging.

## **Application Order**

To ensure predictable pricing, Estizee applies adjustments in the following order:

1. Base pricing
2. Minimum service charge checks
3. Property-specific multipliers
4. Service add-ons
5. Surcharges
6. Frequency or commercial adjustments
7. Manual/admin overrides (if applicable)

## **Best Practices**

- Use multipliers for proportional adjustments rather than flat fees when appropriate
- Apply surcharges only for measurable or justifiable conditions
- Review stacked multipliers to prevent excessive pricing
- Regularly audit pricing rules to maintain consistency and fairness

Correct use of surcharges and multipliers ensures quotes are **accurate, fair, and reflective of job conditions**, while minimizing manual adjustments.
