These settings determine how pricing is calculated when automated rules are applied and how performance targets are tracked internally.

This configuration directly impacts **new quotes only** and does not modify existing quotes, jobs, or invoices.

## **Base Hourly Rate**

The base hourly rate is the default labor value used by Estizee when:

- An admin overrides automated pricing
- A manual or custom quote is created
- A fallback pricing method is required

This rate acts as a safety net to ensure pricing remains consistent even when advanced pricing logic is bypassed.

**Best practices:**

- Set this rate to your true minimum profitable hourly rate
- Review it periodically as labor costs change

## 

## **Revenue Goals**

Revenue goals allow you to define performance targets for your business. These values are used for internal calculations, analytics, and future reporting features.

You can define:

- **Daily revenue goal**
- **Weekly revenue goal**
- **Monthly revenue goal**

Goals do not affect pricing directly but provide visibility into how your actual performance compares to your targets.

## **How These Settings Are Used**

Base Rates & Goals are referenced by Estizee in the following situations:

- Admin-created or adjusted quotes
- Manual pricing scenarios
- Performance tracking and reporting

They are not customer-facing and are used strictly at the business level.

## **Recommended Setup**

To ensure accurate pricing and meaningful performance data:

1. Set your base hourly rate before creating any quotes
2. Define realistic revenue goals based on historical data
3. Revisit these settings quarterly or after major pricing changes

Once configured, Estizee will use these values automatically wherever applicable.
