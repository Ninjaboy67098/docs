All changes apply to **future scheduled jobs only**.

## **Business Hours & Availability**

Configure your working days and hours. Include exceptions for holidays or non-working days. Only time slots within these hours are available for scheduling.

## **Buffer Time Between Jobs**

Set automatic buffer periods between jobs to account for travel, setup, or unforeseen delays. This prevents overbooking and ensures realistic schedules.

## **Default Job Duration**

Estizee uses default durations when scheduling jobs without custom times. Adjust durations to match actual job expectations and complexity.

## **Scheduling Behavior**

Control how jobs are placed on the calendar, including:

- Same-day scheduling rules
- Rescheduling and cancellation handling
- Calendar visibility for team members

## **Team Assignment**

Assign jobs to specific team members or crews. Calendar settings work with Team Management to respect availability and control job ownership visibility.

## **Calendar Integrations**

Integrate with external calendars such as Google Calendar to synchronize your schedule across tools.

## **Best Practices**

- Start with conservative job durations
- Use buffer times to protect the schedule
- Review and adjust availability as your team or season changes

Proper calendar configuration ensures accurate scheduling, reduces conflicts, and keeps daily operations smooth.
