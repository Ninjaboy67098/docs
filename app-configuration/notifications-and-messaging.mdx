These settings define when messages are sent, which channels are used, and how customer consent is handled. All changes apply to **future notifications only**.

## **Communication Channels**

Estizee supports multiple customer communication channels. Each channel can be enabled or disabled independently based on your business preferences.

Supported channels include:

- SMS (text messaging)
- Email

Messages are triggered automatically by system events according to your configuration.

## **SMS Notifications**

SMS notifications are designed for time‑sensitive communication and high open rates.

Common SMS events include:

- Quote sent
- Appointment confirmation
- Appointment reminders
- Job completion notifications

SMS messages are only sent to customers who have explicitly provided consent.

## **Email Notifications**

Email notifications provide detailed communication and documentation.

Common email events include:

- Quote delivery
- Invoice delivery
- Payment receipts
- Job confirmations

Email messages include business branding and structured information for record‑keeping.

## **Consent & Compliance**

Customer consent is required before sending SMS messages.

Estizee enforces:

- Explicit SMS opt‑in
- Proper consent tracking
- Compliance with carrier and messaging regulations

Customers who do not provide consent will not receive SMS messages and will continue to receive email notifications only.

## **Message Timing & Triggers**

Notifications are sent based on system events rather than manual actions.

Examples include:

- When a quote is created or shared
- When a job is scheduled or updated
- When an invoice is issued or paid

This ensures consistent communication without requiring manual follow‑ups.

## **Best Practices**

- Enable SMS for critical time‑sensitive updates only
- Use email for detailed or transactional communication
- Review messaging content periodically for clarity
- Avoid excessive notifications to prevent customer fatigue

When configured correctly, Notifications & Messaging help keep customers informed, reduce missed appointments, and streamline communication without manual effort.
