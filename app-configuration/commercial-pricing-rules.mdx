Commercial pricing is designed to be more flexible than residential pricing and is typically used with **Advanced Quotes** or admin-managed estimates.

All settings in this section apply to **new commercial quotes only**.

## **Pricing Model Overview**

Commercial pricing in Estizee is modular and rule-based. Quotes are calculated using one or more primary pricing methods, combined with frequency rules and conditional adjustments.

At a high level, commercial pricing may include:

- Per-window or per-pane pricing
- Square footage pricing
- Flat-rate or custom pricing
- Frequency-based discounts
- Conditional surcharges

## **Primary Pricing Methods**

You can configure one or multiple pricing methods depending on your business model.

Common methods include:

- **Per window / per pane** pricing
- **Square footage** pricing
- **Flat-rate** pricing for standardized locations

These methods can be used independently or as part of an advanced quote workflow.

## **Frequency Discounts**

Commercial clients often receive discounted pricing based on service frequency.

You can define discounts for:

- Weekly service
- Bi-weekly service
- Monthly service
- Custom service intervals

Frequency rules are applied automatically when the service interval is selected during quoting.

## **Property & Access Surcharges**

Commercial jobs often involve additional complexity. Surcharges allow pricing to reflect these conditions accurately.

Examples include:

- Height or multi-story access
- Difficult access or restricted entry
- Equipment or safety requirements
- Large or complex layouts

Surcharges can be configured as flat fees or percentage-based adjustments.

## **Multi-Unit & Large Properties**

For buildings with multiple units or large footprints, pricing can scale based on:

- Number of units
- Number of floors
- Combined square footage
- Repeated service areas

These rules ensure pricing remains consistent while adapting to property size and scope.

## **Manual & Advanced Pricing**

Commercial pricing frequently involves custom adjustments.

Estizee supports:

- Admin-only price overrides
- Advanced quote customization
- Manual adjustments when required

These options allow flexibility without compromising the underlying pricing structure.

## **Rule Application Order**

Commercial pricing rules are applied in the following order:

1. Primary pricing calculation
2. Frequency discount (if applicable)
3. Property and access surcharges
4. Manual or admin adjustments

This order ensures predictable and auditable pricing behavior.

## **Best Practices**

- Use frequency discounts to encourage recurring contracts
- Keep surcharge rules transparent and easy to justify
- Standardize pricing models where possible
- Review commercial pricing regularly based on contract performance

Once configured, Estizee applies these rules consistently across all commercial estimates, reducing manual work while maintaining pricing control.
