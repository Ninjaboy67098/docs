These rules power the automated estimator and ensure pricing is consistent, scalable, and aligned with your business model.

All settings in this section apply to **new residential quotes only**.

## **Pricing Model Overview**

Residential pricing in Estizee is rule-based. Quote totals are calculated by combining a base pricing model with optional modifiers and add-ons selected during the estimate process.

At a high level, pricing is built from:

- A primary pricing metric (square footage or similar)
- Minimum service thresholds
- Multipliers based on property characteristics
- Optional service add-ons

## **Base Pricing**

Define how the core price of a residential job is calculated.

Common configurations include:

- Price per square foot
- Tiered square footage ranges
- Minimum service charge

The minimum charge ensures small properties still meet your profitability requirements.

## **Property Modifiers**

Property-specific modifiers adjust pricing based on job complexity.

Examples include:

- Number of stories or height multipliers
- Accessibility or difficulty adjustments
- Property type variations (house, condo, apartment)

These modifiers are applied automatically based on user input during quoting.

## **Service Add-Ons**

Add-ons allow you to charge for optional or conditional services.

Typical add-ons include:

- Screen cleaning
- Track cleaning (standard or deep)
- Frame detailing
- First-time or neglected property surcharge
- Post-construction or special-condition cleaning

Each add-on can be configured as a flat fee, per-unit charge, or multiplier.

## **First-Time & Specialty Rules**

You can define additional pricing rules for scenarios that require extra labor or time.

Examples:

- First-time service
- Deep cleaning requirements
- Recently renovated or painted properties
- Hard water or heavy buildup conditions

These rules ensure increased effort is reflected accurately in the final quote.

## **Rule Application Order**

Residential pricing rules are applied in the following order:

1. Base pricing calculation
2. Minimum service check
3. Property modifiers
4. Service add-ons and specialty rules

This order ensures predictable and transparent pricing behavior.

## **Best Practices**

- Keep pricing rules simple and predictable
- Avoid stacking too many multipliers on a single quote
- Review residential pricing regularly based on job performance
- Test quotes internally before sharing with customers

Once configured, Estizee automatically applies these rules to all residential estimates, eliminating manual calculations while maintaining pricing control.
