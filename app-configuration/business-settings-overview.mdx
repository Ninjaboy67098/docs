The **Business Settings** section is the central configuration area for your Estizee account. This is where you define how the system behaves for your business across pricing, scheduling, notifications, team access, and operational rules.

Most settings are configured once during onboarding and adjusted over time as your business evolves.

## What Is Managed in Business Settings

Business Settings allow you to control how Service Mate operates behind the scenes. These configurations directly affect how **new quotes, jobs, invoices, and schedules** are created.

From this section, you manage:

- Service pricing logic and rate structures
- Availability, scheduling, and calendar behavior
- Customer notifications and messaging rules
- Team roles, permissions, and access levels
- Business-level operational preferences

> Changes made here apply **only to future activity** and do not modify existing quotes, jobs, or invoices.
